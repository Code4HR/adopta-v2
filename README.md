Design documents for an Adopt-a-Drain digital redesign

## Background
City of Virginia Beach and City of Norfolk have adopt-a-drain programs for volunteers to maintain the local stormwater relief system. We are communicating with both cities about the digital services that support such a program in order to design and deliver a mobile web platform for adopting drains and other infrastructure that can be maintained by resident volunteers.

### History
Cities have had adopt-a programs for decades. Adopt-a-Spot was a popular national movement in the 1980s and signs can be found throughout the country. The history of Adopt-a as an app goes back to the first Code for America Fellowship Class in 2011. The first Adopt-a app was Adopt-a-hydrant in Boston. Since then, the app has continued to be used and redeployed online with various levels of success and failure.

Here in Virginia Beach and Norfolk we want to learn from the past and design a better future for our Adopt-a-Drain programs.

## Purpose
This repo is for design and discussion using issues and wireframes.
